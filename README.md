- 👋 Hi, I’m @rich702
- 👀 I’m interested in pursuing crypto solutions and blockchain development projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently getting started on learning Stacks/Clarity development.
- I have an extensive Lisp programmming background from earlier career assignments in AI and also delivering "Active Documents" leveraging Interleaf Lisp. I also have a QA engineering background and experience implementing DevOps practices, including a unique Visual BDD approach that leverages requirements models and model-based testing to drive functional test script automation.
- Additionally, I have extensive project management, services delivery, and team building/organizational leadership skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate primarily on L2 solution projects once I am up to speed
- 📫 How to reach me: ramarcotte@tangentbow.com
